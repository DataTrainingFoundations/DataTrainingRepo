1)To go to root use "cd /" command
$ cd /
and then type "pwd" to check / (if your in root)

2)To go to home use cd or cd ~
$ cd 
and then type "pwd" to check /home/wterry (if your in HOME)

Important Commands:

remember: use mkdir --help to see usage and arguments, --help works with any command not just mkdir
also ctrl+l clears console and "exit" exits console

3)mkdir

The mkdir command in Linux/Unix allows users to create or make new directories. mkdir stands for “make directory.”

mkdir dir1
mkdir {test1,test2,test3}
mkdir –p Linux/dirtest1/dirtest2

4)rmdir and rm

The command-line utility for deleting empty directories. It is useful when you want to delete a directory only if it is empty, without needing to check whether the directory is empty or not.

rmdir dir1  ->only empty dir
rm -r dir1   ->dir with contents
rm -r dir1 dir2 dir3 ->all listed directory will be deleted

try:
rm -r Linux

this removes all of subdirectories created above

5) cp 

a) Two file names : If the command contains two file names, then it copy the contents of 1st file to the 2nd file. If the 2nd file doesn’t exist, then first it creates one and content is copied to it. But if it existed then it is simply overwritten without any warning. So be careful when you choose destination file name.

cp Src_file Dest_file

6) cd

Change directory

cd -> defaults to value of HOME shell variable
cd / -> go to root
cd .. -> '..' is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component

7) ls 

for listing the data in the folders

ls -> list down
ls -t -> sort by modification time
ls -1 -> Display One File Per Line 
ls -l -> Display All Information About Files/Directories 
ls -lt -> Order Files Based on Last Modified Time
ls -ltr-> Order Files Based on Last Modified Time (In Reverse Order)


8) cat

Cat(concatenate) command is very frequently used in Linux. It reads data from the file and gives their content as output. It helps us to create, view, concatenate files. So let us see some frequently used cat commands. 

$cat filename -> To view a single file 

$cat file1 file2 -> To view multiple files 

$ cat >newfile -> Will create a file named newfile


9)grep

Grep is a Linux / Unix command-line tool used to search for a string of characters in a specified file. The text search pattern is called a regular expression. When it finds a match, it prints the line with the result. The grep command is handy when searching through large log files.

a)$ grep "literal_string" filename.

b)$ grep "this" demo_file

c)$ history | grep dnf


10)echo

echo command in linux is used to display line of text/string that are passed as an argument . This is a built in command that is mostly used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a file.

echo -e "Geeks \bfor \bGeeks"

echo -e "Geeks \cfor Geeks"

echo -e "Geeks \nfor \nGeeks"

echo -e "Geeks \tfor \tGeeks"

echo -e "Geeks \rfor Geeks"

echo -e "Geeks \vfor \vGeeks

11)df

The df command (short for disk free), is used to display information related to file systems about total space and available space.

df
df /home/wterry/
df -a  ->If you want to display all the file system, use -a option.
df --total  ->To get complete grand total, use –total option
du 


12)chmod
In Unix-like operating systems, the chmod command is used to change the access mode of a file.
The name is an abbreviation of change mode.

The references are used to distinguish the users to whom the permissions apply i.e. they are list of letters that specifies whom to give permissions. The references are represented by one or more of the following letters:

Reference   Class     Description
u          owner      file's owner

g          group      users who are members of
                      the file's group

o          others     users who are neither the
                      file's owner nor members of 
                      the file's group

a          all       All three of the above, same as ugo


The operator is used to specify how the modes of a file should be adjusted. The following operators are accepted:

Operator  Description
+         Adds the specified modes to the
          specified classes

-         Removes the specified modes from 
          the specified classes

=         The modes specified are to be made
          the exact modes for the specified 
          classes

The modes inUse the ls -l command to find out who owns a file or what group the file belongs to:

indicate which permissions are to be granted or removed from the specified classes. There are three basic modes 
which correspond to the basic permissions:

r       Permission to read the file.
w       Permission to write (or delete) the file.
x       Permission to execute the file, or, in
        the case of a directory, search it.

ls -l

before 
drwxrwxr-x  mik   mik   EXAM

 chmod u=rw EXAM 

after
 drw-rwxr-x   mik  mik    EXAM

13)chown
The chown command allows you to change the user and/or group ownership of a given file, directory, or symbolic link.in

ls -l filename.txt


-rw-r--r-- 12 linuxize users 12.0K Apr  8 20:51 filename.txt
|[-][-][-]-   [------] [---]
                |       |
                |       +-----------> Group
                +-------------------> Owner
To change the owner of a file use the chown command followed by the user name of the new owner and the target file as an argument

chown USER FILE


14)find

The find command in UNIX is a command line utility for walking a file hierarchy. It can be used to find files and directories and perform subsequent operations on them.

find . -name test1.txt  ->Search a file with specific name.
find . -maxdepth 1 -name 'test*'     ->Search a file with pattern.

15)history
history command is used to view the previously executed command. 

history 
history 5 
history | grep find


16)ps
Linux provides us a utility called ps for viewing information related with the processes on a system which stands as abbreviation for “Process Status”

ps
ps -A

PID – the unique process ID
TTY – terminal type that the user is logged into
TIME – amount of CPU in minutes and seconds that the process has been running
CMD – name of the command that launched the process.

17)kill

kill command in Linux (located in /bin/kill), is a built-in command which is used to terminate processes manually.

kill -l
ps
kill pid ->To show how to use a PID with the kill command.

18)sed
SED command in UNIX is stands for stream editor and it can perform lot’s of function on file like, searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion.

cat > geekfile.txt

sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt -->Replacing or substituting string
sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt -->Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line

19)nohup

nohup (No Hang Up) is a command in Linux systems that runs the process even after logging out from the shell/terminal. 

nohup --version
nohup bash geekfile.sh
nohup bash geekfile.sh > output.txt
